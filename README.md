# HLDA
Generalized HLDA python script

 This code creates a collective variable (defined as a linear combination of input descriptors)
 that maximizes the separation of two classes (or states) using harmonic linear discriminant analysis.
 (J. Chem. Phys. 149, 194113 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5053566)

 A csv file is required with the 2 classses: column labels using the values (l) in the dictionary and 'class'

 The code was developed and applied in this paper: One Descriptor to Fold Them All: Harnessing Intuition and MachineLearning to Identify Transferable Lasso Peptide Reaction Coordinates
